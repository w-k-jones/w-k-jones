### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm William Jones, a Postdoc researcher in the [Climate Processes Group](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/climate-processes) at the University of Oxford. I study deep convective storm clouds, with a focus on linking convective processes to anvil properties and their cloud radiative effect. I develop novel cloud tracking software to do this, and apply it to both geostationary satellite observations and global km-scale models.
